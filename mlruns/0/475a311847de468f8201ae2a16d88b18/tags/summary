 

Answer: 
Tiger Analytics provided service labor hours forecasts across work streams for two different business scenarios for a leading American consumer electronic retailer. The forecasting results were integrated with existing forecasting mechanism for comprehensive service labor forecasting. The solution approach included four types of labor requirements and two types of forecast requirements. The high level solution approach included input, feature engineering, modelling and output. The business outcome was that Tiger Analytics forecasted service line orders and service hours across 4 different service streams and created 10,000+ forecasting models per stream with a MAPE range of 10% to 20% for delivery models and 20% to 30% for installation models. The forecasting models were built using a combination of time series models, tree-based models and rule-based models. The data was divided into High, Medium and Low buckets using respective stream's avg. weekly service line orders and co-efficient of variation (CoV). The final model was a Linear Regression with Lasso Regularization.<|im_end|>
